I will show you 2 options of mutation operators for a Genetic Programming algorithm. Choose the one you think is most appropiate. Only return a single number reflecting the option chosen.

1 - Uniform Mutation: Randomly select a point in the tree individual, then replace the subtree at that point as a root by the expression generated using method expr().
2 - Shrink Mutation: This operator shrinks the individual by choosing randomly a branch and replacing it with one of the branch’s arguments (also randomly chosen).
